# Hooks-React
Creating the same Robo Friends instead of using Hooks as new implementation to the code 

This is the stage when I start to write code more in depth with _REACT.JS_ using the _ZTM_
online course and _REACT documentation_

### REACT Overview
As the docmentation stating the as React is a online Playground Other resources [_CodePen_](https://codepen.io/pen?&editors=0010&layout=left),[_CodeSandobx_](https://codesandbox.io/s/new),or [_StackBlitz_](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ppuct5).

If you prefer to use your own text edito, you can also [_download this HTML file_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/main/static/html/single-file-example.html), edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your borwser, it does a slow runtime code transformation, So I would recommend using this for simple demos.

Although am not going to explain the basics of _REACT.JS_ at this stage since I have already gone through it before but more I would get into _Hooks_ instead

### Using the State Hook
#### What's a Hook?

The example starts by importing the `useState` Hook from React:
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  //....
}
```
**What is a Hook?** A hook is a special function that lets you "hook" into React features. For example, `useState()` is a React specific hook that lets you add React state to function components.

**And Learned when would I use a Hook?** if you write a function component and realise you need to add some state to it generally speaking when replacing `class` from `Object Contructor` in JavaScript - when previously you had to covert it to a class. Now you can use Hook inside the existing function component. 

Please Refer to [**_React.js documentation_**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
